# Galactic Bot


### What is Galactic?

Galactic is a multipurpose bot with tons of moderation, automod, music, economy, and counting commands. You will never need another bot again!



### Why should you get Galactic?

Galactic has a ton of features that the other bots have, but you dont have to pay for them. Galactic is constantly getting updated so if it doesnt have a feature that you want, do not fear! You can always suggest more features on the support server, and I am always active on it as well. I am sure that you will like this bot, so I donâ€™t have any fears.
